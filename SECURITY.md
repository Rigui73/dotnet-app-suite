## Secure Dependencies Management

To ensure the security of our dependencies, we follow these best practices:

- **Regularly update dependencies**: We use automated tools such as Dependabot, Snyk, or npm audit to monitor and update dependencies.
- **Pin dependencies**: We specify exact versions in package manifests to prevent unintended updates.
- **Review third-party packages**: Before adding a new dependency, we evaluate its security posture and maintenance activity.
- **Monitor for security advisories**: We subscribe to security bulletins for critical libraries and update as needed.
- **Use code scanning tools**: We leverage static analysis and vulnerability scanning to detect issues early.

For any security-related questions, please reach out to our security team at [contacto@eadriarigall.com](mailto:contacto@eadriarigall.com).
