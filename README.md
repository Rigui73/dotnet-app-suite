## Included Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

### 1. `DataManager` (C# Console Application - CRUD with SQL Server)

A console application that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a SQL Server database.

### 2. `DataAPI` (Web API)

A Web API that interacts with the SQL Server database, providing an interface for performing CRUD operations via HTTP requests.

### 3. `ClientAPI` (C# console application that uses the Web API)

A second console application that consumes the Web API to interact with data, rather than directly accessing the database.

### 4. `MauiAppConnect` (MAUI Application)

A MAUI application that also connects to the Web API to interact with the SQL Server database, demonstrating how to build cross-platform applications with .NET.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- **.NET 6.0 or higher** (including MAUI for cross-platform applications)
- **SQL Server** (or a SQL Server-compatible database)
- **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Code** with .NET support
- Tools for working with APIs such as **Postman** or **cURL** (if you want to test the API directly)
