# Why :heart: contribute

If you've made it this far, it's probably because you're thinking about contributing to this project.

We welcome you and encourage you to contribute to improving this project. Of course, in that case, your name will be added to the contribution list. :smile: :white_check_mark:

In this project, we value any contribution, no matter how small. That's why we don't have a section for first-time contributions.

1. Little things make a big difference. Just choose something you're interested in and start working on it.

2. If you have any questions, please ask. There's a lot of code. ![Discord-chat](https://img.shields.io/discord/680332596693172234?color=blue&logo=discord&logoColor=white)

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, we would appreciate it if you did not disclose it publicly. The [issue](https://www.github.com/Rigui73/dotnet-issue) section and the [mailing list](https://www.github.com/Rigui73/BashShell/.mailmap) are completely public. If you need to reach system developers in a non-public way, please report the issue to [contacto@adriarigall.com](mailto:contacto@adriarigall.com)

## Prepare the workspace

### Fork and create a branch

Create a branch of the project using `feature-id`, `hotfix-id`, `test-id` or `docs-id`.

- `feature` - For improvements and new developments.
- `hotfix` - For bugs and fixes.
- `test` - For testing.
- `docs` - For documentation.
- `id` - Number assigned on GitHub.

Example:

`sh git checkout -b feature-625`

### Build & Packaging

Pull requests to fix compilation or packaging issues on other operating systems or package managers will be gladly accepted, but issues without code fixes will be closed as stated above.

### Implement Your Fix or Feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

### Get the Style Right

Your contribution should follow the same style guidelines as the rest of the project. You can check for and fix style issues by running each linter individually. Run `bin/rake -T lint` to see the available linters. Format your code with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).

### Add a Change Log Entry

If your PR includes user-observable changes, you'll be prompted to add a record in [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)

The change log format is as follows:

- One line per PR describing its fix or enhancement.
- Entries end with a period, followed by "[#pr-number] by [@github-username]".
- Entries are added to the "Unreleased" section at the top of the file, under the "Bug Fixes" or "Enhancements" subsection.

## Issues

- **Do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead refer to ours.

- **Make sure the bug hasn't already been reported** by searching GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues).

- We only track bugs in the two most recently published versions on GitHub. If you are using an older version, please contact your distribution's bug tracker.

- When filing an issue, please specify the version you are experiencing the issue with. Also, please indicate which distribution you are using.

- Include an explanation on how to reproduce the issue you are reporting.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that appears to be the same as the one you are experiencing, please open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of the new issue.

- If you cannot find an open issue that addresses the problem, please open a new one. If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the contents of the appropriate template into an .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and paste the contents into the issue description.

- [**Active Record** (models, database) issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_master.rb)
- [**Action Pack** (controllers, routing) issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller_master.rb)
- [**Generic template** for other issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/generic_master.rb)
